# Hate Speech Detection using Deep Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to detect hate speech in text using deep learning techniques. The model is trained to classify text into categories such as hate speech, offensive language, and neutral speech. By leveraging NLP techniques, the project provides an effective way to combat harmful content online.

## 🚀 Features
- Text Preprocessing (Tokenization, Stopword Removal, Lemmatization)
- Model Training using Deep Learning (LSTM, CNN, or Transformer-based models)
- Hate Speech Classification
- Model Performance Evaluation

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## 📊 Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project contains labeled textual data for hate speech detection. It includes:
- **Text**: The content of user comments/posts.
- **Label**:
  - **0**: Neutral (Non-hate speech)
  - **1**: Offensive Language
  - **2**: Hate Speech
- **Additional Features**: May include metadata such as user ID, timestamps, etc.

## 🏠 Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mr-Usmanprof/Hate_Speech_Detection.git
   cd Hate_Speech_Detection
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to train and evaluate the model.

## 📈 Results & Insights
The deep learning model achieves high accuracy in detecting hate speech. Key evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score confirm the model's effectiveness in identifying offensive content.
