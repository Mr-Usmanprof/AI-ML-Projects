# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. By analyzing transactional data, we develop a model that identifies suspicious activities to prevent financial fraud.

## 🚀 Features
- Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
- Model Training using Machine Learning Algorithms
- Fraudulent Transaction Detection
- Model Performance Evaluation

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

## 📊 Dataset Information
The dataset contains anonymized credit card transactions labeled as fraudulent or non-fraudulent. It includes:
- Transaction Amount
- Timestamp
- Various numerical features representing transaction details

## 🏗️ Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mr-Usmanprof/Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.git
   cd Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to train and evaluate the model.

## 📈 Results & Insights
The model successfully identifies fraudulent transactions with high accuracy. Evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score confirm its effectiveness.
